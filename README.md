The goal of this repository is to collect and develop domain analysis content for the phenotypic domain.

In July of 2019 the NIH issued a notice (NOT-OD-19-122) to encourage investigators to explore the current uses of FHIR in research to ultimately improve methods for clinical researchers to use, standardize, and share electronic health data. The Broad Institute as a host institution for the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) was one of two sites awarded a contract to pursue these goals under NIH/NLM contract #75N97019P00280, in partnership with the Jackson Lab, Oregon Health & Science University, Oregon State University, and Mayo Clinic. The project goals are to:

- coordinate with the appropriate HL7 FHIR work group(s) and develop a FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) based on the data modeled in the GA4GH Phenopackets schema,
- identify sets of translational research partners to demonstrate data exchange using FHIR application programing interfaces (APIs) for selected use cases,
- develop Driver Use Cases to inform IG development and for pilot-testing,
- support pilot-testing,
- compile pilot test results into a report,
- provide feedback to HL7 to revise relevant FHIR resources, profiles, and/or IGs,
- provide feedback to GA4GH on Phenopackets schema and application to use cases, and
- disseminate deliverables and obtain feedback for future development.

The dissemination plan outlined here addresses goal 8 defined above.  [Brief background on context/need for dissemination and basis for proposed dissemination approach/activities]   We are proposing dissemination activities to [xx audiences] through a mix of [what mechanisms?].
