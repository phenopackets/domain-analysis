Phenopackets
===========================

Phenopackets is a well established GA4GH schema for capturing and exchanging structured phenotypic data to support comon research and clinical workflows. This project will examine the current Phenopackets model, the underlying domain it represents, technical data representation issues, etc. in order to understand how it relates to FHIRâ€™s model and data representations and identify any new areas of development for either standard. The goal is to enhance both standards where possible and provide technical guidance and tools to support data integration and interoperability.

The `Phenopackets project <https://phenopackets-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html>`_ describes it as:

  *The Phenopacket Schema represents an open standard for sharing disease and phenotype information to improve our ability to understand, diagnose, and treat both rare and common diseases. A Phenopacket links detailed phenotype descriptions with disease, patient, and genetic information, enabling clinicians, biologists, and disease and drug researchers to build more complete models of disease (see Disease for the distinction between disease and phenotypic feature). The standard is designed to encourage wide adoption and synergy between the people, organizations and systems that comprise the joint effort to address human disease and biological understanding.*
