===================
Use Cases
===================

This project will develop use cases to help guide the development of the technical artifacts related to the Phenopackets specification.  Use cases can be proposed and provided by community members, and they will be collected as a part of this documentation for the benefit of the community and future projects.


* **Driver use cases** guide the technical development for the duration of the project. They represent a small subset of use cases that could be developed within the scientific and clinical domains that are covered by the Phenopackets specification. They are used to scope the work done by the project team in coordination with the project sponsor.
* **Community use cases** are an unconstrained set of use cases related to the Phenopackets specification.  They are captured in this documentation to inform future work, including discussions regarding the scope and intent of the specification as well as the development of technical artifacts.


Please see the :doc:`driver <usecases-driver>` and :doc:`community <usecases-community>` 
use cases pages for additional details.
