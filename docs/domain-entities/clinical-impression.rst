Clinical impression
==============================

This is a high level clinical assessment and workflow/summary related entity. It is distinct but closely related to the more granular observations, diagnosis, investigations entities.

FHIR does a fairly good job defining and modeling this entity with `the ClinicalImpression resource <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/clinicalimpression.html>`_.

The FHIR ClinicalImpression model is good knowledge to keep in mind while we go through the analysis and modeling of the smaller supporting entities. However, a full analysis and modeling of this domain entity is premature at this point, and not clearly needed by year 1 use cases, so it will be deferred until it is clearly needed and we have resolved and implemented most of the other supporting entities needed for this entity.
