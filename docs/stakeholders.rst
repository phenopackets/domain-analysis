==================
Stakeholders
==================
The domain analysis will identify various stakeholders involved in developing 
standards and other technical solutions for the use and exchange of phenotypic 
information. The goal of this content is to provide a central resource for all 
relevant stakeholders, their working groups, significant resources provided by 
each stakeholder, and how to engage with each of them. The following is an initial
list of stakeholders. Others will be added as part of the domain analysis and 
further information will be collected for each stakeholder.
