FHIR
=================

The FHIR specification was mostly developed for clinical systems and is heavily focused on established clinical workflows. Itâ€™s not as well developed for the research domain, or for capturing more granular clinical facts such as phenotypic level information. However, it does have some foundational building blocks that could be extended (with FHIR extensions) or could be further developed in future specification versions to accommodate both of these areas. The analysis will be focused on two main areas.

--------------------
FHIR representation
--------------------
The analysis will examine and document how the FHIR framework represents 
phenotypic information, which FHIR resources are applicable, and the various 
gaps that need to be addressed with FHIR extensions or future FHIR development.

-----------------------
Phenopackets mapping
-----------------------
This part of the FHIR analysis will specify how the Phenopackets schema maps 
to FHIR resources. This process will provide the mappings needed for technical 
development but it will also help identity possible enhancements to either FHIR 
or Phenopackets to bring them into more alignment in how they represent the 
underlying domain.
