Community Use Cases
===========================

A Community Use Case describes the specific information needs, data types, and any relevant domain or technical aspects that a stakeholder needs to support their goals. The community use cases, as opposed to the :doc:`Driver Use Cases <usecases-driver>`, will primarily be developed by the wider community, not the project team, and will be retained for future use by the Phenopackets project. The project team will establish a workflow for how to collect and evolve these use cases for the benefit of all stakeholders. These use cases will initially be captured as a GitHub issue in the `domain analysis repository <https://github.com/phenopackets/domain-analysis/issues>`_ to facilitate community discussion and development, and will be merged into this document when mature.
