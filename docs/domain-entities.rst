Domain entities
============================

One aspect of the domain analysis is the identification of relevant domain concepts, how people in the domain understand and use them, what data is collected about them or in relation to them, etc. This includes concepts such as person, patient, study subject, diagnosis, signs and symptoms, family, pedigree, etc. People in the domain have a clear and intuitive understanding of these concepts but they also appropriately adjust their understanding and use of these concepts based on the domain context. This frequently leads to difficulties when it comes to data modeling and interoperability.

This section aims to identify these concepts and represent them as modeling entities. This process usually involves capturing the various ways these concepts exist in the domain, giving clear definitions and making clear distinctions, and creating new entities with new labels when a domain concept might be too general or vague and can imply very different entities for different people in the domain or in different domain contexts.

The process for developing this content will likely start as a glossary of the various concepts. They will then be fully defined and contrasted with each other to have clear boundaries, specific relationships will be established, data elements will be defined, appropriate terminologies and ontologies will be identified, etc. in order to support the latter technical development efforts.
