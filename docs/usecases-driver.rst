Driver Use Cases
===========================
The following driver use cases will guide the technical development during the current project period. Please see the :doc:`community use cases <usecases-community>` for additional use cases contributed by the community that could guide future work on this project.

A Driver Use Case represents the same content as a  Community Use Case, but it is primarily developed by the project team for the purpose of guiding the technical development and testing activities during the project period. These use cases will be based on clinical and research topics developed in coordination with the pilot sites, involve interactions with FHIR and Phenopackets technical components, and specify the data flow, goals, and outcomes of the use case. For this project, the Driver Use Cases will be largely based on existing domain models in Phenopackets and FHIR, and existing terminologies. The primary goal of these use cases is to integrate existing technical solutions rather than evolve any specific one of them. However, in pursuing integration, specific gaps and enhancements will be needed and will be proposed for future development. These use cases will be documented and analyzed within the Domain Analysis Document.

Kids First FHIR interoperability and Phenopackets extraction
============================================================
This is a Kids First based use case to demonstrate core data interoperability between the evolving Kids First Implemenation Guide (IG), developed separately, and the Core IG that is being developed during this project. Kids First initially attempted to adopt an existing Phenopackets-based FHIR IG to expose existing data through a FHIR API. This effort led to some difficulty with aligning their data, and the development of a new FHIR IG for Kids First. This use case will be based on the scientific and program goals of Kids First.  In applying the use case to this project, we will analyze the Kids First IG, one of the Kids First datasets being exposed with this IG, along with the existing Phenopackets IG and the Phenopackets native schema, to specify and demonstrate data interoperability for core entities represented by these different models and FHIR IGs. Specifically, the following will be implemented and tested by this use case:

- We will develop a user story based on the Kids First dataset that illustrates a clinical and/or translational use of the type of data that is supported by the Phenopackets specification.
- We will use the Kids First IG, one of the Kids First datasets exposed with the Kids First IG, and the Phenopackets schema to identify at least 3 core entities that will be modeled in the Core IG.
- The core entities will be thoroughly documented and analyzed in this Domain Analysis Document to better understand the scope of the FHIR representation in the Core IG.
- A demonstration FHIR server instance will be stood up and the Core IG will be loaded into this instance for validation of the IG, and for data validation during subsequent interactions.
- Demonstration of data exchange between the Kids First IG and server and the Core IG and its demonstration server. This could be accomplished with Jupyter notebook examples or other code snippets. This will test and document any issues around FHIR to FHIR interoperability between the two IGs and how to address them going forward.
- Write POC code to extract Phenopackets instance(s) in the native format by querying Core IG based data to test interoperability between the Core IG and the current Phenopackets schema.

This use case is focused on advancing the representation of phenotypic data in FHIR, primarily through:

- Technical interoperability
- Data exchange
- The Core IG being the core common denominator/hub for interoperability between the Kids First IG, the existing Phenopackets IG, and the Phenopackets native schema
- Help us establish and test our technical artifacts and workflow for ongoing IG development beyond the period of this project.
- This use case is focused on data representation and message exchange for few core entities. Higher level domain or application specific use cases will build on the development guided by this use case.

Phenotype-driven molecular genetic diagnostics
==============================================
This use case demonstrates the value of FHIR interoperability in a clinical setting. The goal is to enhance the communication of phenotypic information in clinical settings to support well-established clinical workflows.

Clinicians and hospitals send blood or DNA samples to a laboratory for molecular diagnostics of Mendelian disorders. Traditionally, little or no detailed information about clinical phenotypes is provided. In the experience of Peter Robinson, paper entry forms were used which allowed submitters to name the suspected diagnosis or other relevant clinical information. In the NGS era, where gene panels, exomes, or genomes are used for diagnostics in cases where the underlying diagnosis is unknown, it would be highly desirable to have more information about phenotypic findings to guide interpretation of NGS findings.

We will demonstrate the exchange of phenotypic information to a hypothetical lab by using our POC Core IG FHIR server. The laboratory request, the Phenopackets file, and any native FHIR representations of the same phenotypic information for the attached Phenopackets file will be communicated to the POC server. This will simulate the submission to a real FHIR based laboratory/EHR API. We will also demonstrate how the laboratory could retrieve such a request and related clinical information from the POC server to demonstrate how an existing laboratory could still benefit for a third party FHIR server to obtain structured and computable information. We will also simulate the fulfillment of the laboratory request through the POC server. The richness of the data communicated for this use case, and through the POC server, will be limited to the extent it is modeled in the Core IG. However, weâ€™ll also explore the possibility of additional data exchange based on the base FHIR spec when possible. We will also demonstrate how to attach any related artifacts (PDFs for example) to FHIR messages to support existing forms of communication in addition to our attempt to provide a structured form of the same information in the form of FHIR resources or Phenopackets instances.
